#### Container to Container Communication
All the containers inside the pod have the same IP address as assigned to the Pod. The **container to container communication happens over the localhost.** 
<br><br/>
In the diagram shown above Pod1 is a multi-container pod (with containers C1 and C2) and Pod2, Pod3 and Pod4 are single container pods. The Container to container communication is shown in the diagram above with green line.
